# AmIResponding?

This project provides [IamResponding](https://iamresponding.com/v3/Pages/Default.aspx)-type functionality for free and within a Slack team. It utilizes Slack's [bot users API](https://api.slack.com/bot-users) to post an [interactive message](https://api.slack.com/interactive-messages) when a call is dispatched.

This interactive message posts some information about the call and queries channel members if they're responding or not. It the posts for the channel to see each person's status.

Here's how a dispatch looks in Slackâ€”with a few people who responded to the call:
